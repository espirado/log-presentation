# System Architecture Overview
Our system follows a modular, layered architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

```mermaid {theme: 'neutral', scale: 0.8}
graph TD
    A[Log Sources] --> B[Data Layer]
    B --> C[Analysis Layer]
    C --> D[Visualization Layer]
    
    subgraph "Data Layer"
    B1[Log Parser] --> B2[Stream Processor]
    B2 --> B3[Data Enrichment]
    end
    
    subgraph "Analysis Layer"
    C1[Base Analyzer] --> C2[LLM Analyzer]
    C2 --> C3[Stream Analyzer]
    end
    
    subgraph "Visualization Layer"
    D1[Chart Generator] --> D2[Real-time Metrics]
    end
```
The layered architecture allows for flexible deployment options, from simple pattern matching to sophisticated AI-powered analysis, depending on your needs.

# Analysis Layer Overview

Our analysis layer implements a sophisticated multi-tiered approach to log processing, combining traditional pattern matching with advanced AI capabilities.

```mermaid {theme: 'neutral', scale: 0.8}
graph TD
    A[Log Input] --> B[Base Analyzer]
    B --> C[LLM Analyzer]
    B --> D[Enhanced Analyzer]
    B --> E[Stream Analyzer]
    
    subgraph "Analysis Components"
    C --> F[Context Detection]
    C --> G[Pattern Recognition]
    D --> H[Performance Tracking]
    E --> I[Real-time Processing]
    end

```

#  Base Analyzer Implementation

The Base Analyzer serves as the foundation of our analysis system, defining the core interface and essential methods that all analyzers must implement.

```ts
class BaseAnalyzer:
    def analyze_chunk(self, chunk: LogChunk) -> Analysis:
        """Base interface for log analysis"""
        raise NotImplementedError
        
    def extract_patterns(self, chunk: LogChunk) -> List[Pattern]:
        """Extract common patterns from logs"""
        raise NotImplementedError
        
    def get_context(self, patterns: List[Pattern]) -> Context:
        """Determine log context from patterns"""
        raise NotImplementedError
```
This abstract base class ensures consistency across different analyzer implementations while providing flexibility for various analysis strategies. The interface defines three critical operations:

<v-clicks>

- Define common interface for standardized analyzer behavior
- Establish pattern extraction methods for identifying log patterns
- Provide context determination capabilities


</v-clicks>

# LLM Analyzer Implementation
The LLM Analyzer represents our integration with GPT models, bringing natural language understanding to log analysis. This enables more nuanced and context-aware analysis of complex log patterns.

```ts
class LLMAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo"):
        self.client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
        self.model = model
        
    async def analyze_chunk(self, chunk: LogChunk) -> Analysis:
        patterns = self.extract_patterns(chunk)
        context = self.get_context(patterns)
        response = await self._get_llm_analysis(context)
        return self._parse_response(response)
        
    async def _get_llm_analysis(self, context: Context) -> Dict:
        """Get analysis from OpenAI API"""
        response = await asyncio.to_thread(
            self.client.chat.completions.create,
            model=self.model,
            messages=[{
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an expert log analyzer."
            }, {
                "role": "user",
                "content": self._build_prompt(context)
            }]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

# This implementation leverages GPT's capabilities to:

- Understand complex log patterns beyond simple regex matching
- Provide context-aware analysis of log entries
- Generate human-readable explanations of issues
- Suggest potential remediation steps

The async design ensures efficient processing of large log volumes while maintaining responsiveness.

# Enhanced Analyzer Implementation
The Enhanced Analyzer builds upon the LLM Analyzer by adding sophisticated metrics tracking, confidence scoring, and advanced error handling capabilities.

```ts
class EnhancedAnalyzer(LLMAnalyzer):
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, model: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo"):
        super().__init__(api_key, model)
        self.performance_metrics = {
            'response_times': [],
            'success_rate': [],
            'error_counts': defaultdict(int)
        }
        
    async def analyze_chunk(self, chunk: LogChunk) -> Analysis:
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            analysis = await super().analyze_chunk(chunk)
            analysis['confidence_score'] = self._calculate_confidence(analysis)
            analysis['performance_impact'] = self._assess_impact(analysis)
            analysis['remediation_steps'] = await self._generate_remediation(analysis)
            self._update_metrics(time.time() - start_time, True)
            return analysis
        except Exception as e:
            self._update_metrics(time.time() - start_time, False)
            return self._get_error_analysis(str(e))


```

# Stream Analyzer Implementation
The Stream Analyzer extends our capabilities to real-time log processing, enabling continuous analysis of log streams with optimized resource usage.

```ts
class StreamAnalyzer(EnhancedAnalyzer):
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, batch_size: int = 100):
        super().__init__(api_key)
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.current_batch = []
        self.pattern_cache = {}
        
    async def process_log(self, log: str):
        self.current_batch.append(log)
        if len(self.current_batch) >= self.batch_size:
            await self._process_batch()
            
    async def _process_batch(self):
        chunk = LogChunk(self.current_batch)
        analysis = await self.analyze_chunk(chunk)
        self._update_patterns(analysis)
        self.current_batch = []
